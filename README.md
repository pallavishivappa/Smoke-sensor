# Smoke-sensor
An IoT-enabled smoke detection system that reads air quality using an analog sensor on pin A0. When smoke levels cross the threshold, it activates a buzzer alert and logs data to the Serial Monitor. The IoT integration makes it suitable for smart safety solutions with real-time monitoring and alerts.
